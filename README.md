## Description

This project is concerned with implementing a complete toolchain for translating an assembly (.s) file into executable machine code, modeled after the GNU toolchain tools.

#### Technologies

- Flex [Flex is utilized as part of the lexing process]
- Bison [Bison is employed in the parsing phase]
- The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) [It is used in conjunction with C++ to facilitate the implementation of data structures and operations performed on them]
- Make [Make is used to automate the building and compilation of project by specifying dependencies and the steps required to build the project]

## How To Use

#### Installation
The tool chain was designed and implemented to be used on the Linux operating system, and therefore uses the make tool to link all files. (If you want to use this tool from the Windows operating system, you need to use a tool that will allow you to run <b>Make</b> inside the Windows operating system, such as <b>Cygwin</b>)
<br/ >
You can find more about the Make tool and its use, as well as the documentation on the website:
```html
    https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
```
In addition to the Make tool, <b>Flex</b> and <b>Bison</b> tools were also used in this project. Flex was used as a lexeme generator, while Bison was used for parsing. You can find more about these tools, as well as their documentation for use, at the following link:
